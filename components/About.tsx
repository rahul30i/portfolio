        Hello! I'm Rahul, a Computer Science engineer passionate about building intelligent and user-centric applications from end to end. ðŸš€

My expertise lies at the unique intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Full-Stack Development. I leverage AI and Machine Learning with Python to create smart, data-driven solutions, and I build robust, scalable web applications using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) to bring those solutions to life.

All of my work is built on a strong foundation in core computer science principles, including Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) and object-oriented programming with Java. I thrive on tackling complex challenges and turning innovative ideas into functional, seamless products. Welcome to my portfolio!
